oEmbed API
==========
oEmbed is Embedly's basic offering, providing a simple API for embedding
content from any URL. This method follows the `oEmbed <http://oembed.com>`_
standard.

Example call (1 URL)::

    http://api.embed.ly/1/oembed?key=:key&url=:url&maxwidth=:maxwidth&maxheight=:maxheight&format=:format&callback=:callback

Example call (multiple URLs)::

    http://api.embed.ly/1/oembed?key=:key&urls=:url1,:url2,:url3&maxwidth=:maxwidth&maxheight=:maxheight&format=:format&callback=:callback

oEmbed Types
------------

``photo``
    This is a static viewable image.

``video``
    This is a playable video.

``rich``
    This is rich HTML that may contain images and videos.

``link``
    This is a general embed that may not contain HTML.

``error``
    When accessing multiple urls at once, Embedly will not throw HTTP errors as

The photo type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This type is used for representing static photos. The following parameters are
defined:

``url`` (required)
    The source URL of the image. Consumers should be able to insert this URL
    into an``<img>``element. Only HTTP and HTTPS URLs are valid.

``width`` (required)
    The width in pixels of the image specified in the ``url`` parameter.

``height`` (required)
    The height in pixels of the image specified in the ``url`` parameter.


The video type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This type is used for representing playable videos. The following parameters
are defined:

``html`` (required)
    The HTML required to embed a video player. The HTML should have no padding
    or margins. Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off-domain iframe to
    avoid XSS vulnerabilities.

``width``
    The width in pixels required to display the HTML. If not supplied
    the HTML returned will expand horizontally to the size of its parent
    container.

``height``
    The height in pixels required to display the HTML. If not supplied
    the HTML returned will expand vertically to the size of its parent
    container.


The link type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Responses of this type allow a provider to return any generic embed data (such
as title and author_name), without providing either the url or html parameters.
The consumer may then link to the resource, using the URL specified in the
original request.

The rich type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This type is used for rich HTML content that does not fall under one of the
other categories. The following parameters are defined:

``html`` (required)
    The HTML required to display the resource. The HTML should have no padding
    or margins. Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off-domain iframe to
    avoid XSS vulnerabilities. The markup should be valid XHTML 1.0 Basic.

``width``
    The width in pixels required to display the HTML. If not supplied
    the HTML returned will expand horizontally to the size of its parent
    container.

``height``
