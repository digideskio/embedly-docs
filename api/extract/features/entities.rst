Entities
========
The ``entities`` object gives you a list of proper nouns
(persons, places, and things) extracted from the article
or blog text of a URL. Along with each entity name, Embedly counts
the number of times it appears in the text. You can find
this data in the
:doc:`Extract <../endpoints/1/extract>` endpoint.

Example
-------
An example ``entities`` value
for an `Article </docs/explore/objectify?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusnews.nbcnews.com%2F_news%2F2013%2F02%2F26%2F17107343-florida-man-shot-by-his-dog-police-say%3Flite&maxwidth=500>`_ would be:
