Preview API
===========
This is a ``Legacy Endpoint``. :doc:`Learn more </api/legacy/endpoints/index>`.

The Preview endpoint is designed to provide users with a number of different
options to build an embed with. For instance, whereas the
:doc:`oEmbed endpoint </api/embed/endpoints/1/oembed>` only provides what Embedly thinks
is the best thumbnail image for a page, Preview potentially returns several.

Example call (1 URL)::

    http://api.embed.ly/1/preview?key=:key&url=:url&maxwidth=:maxwidth&maxheight=:maxheight&format=:format&callback=:callback

Example call (multiple URLs)::

    http://api.embed.ly/1/preview?key=:key&urls=:url1,:url2,:url3&maxwidth=:maxwidth&maxheight=:maxheight&format=:format&callback=:callback

of attributes.

    or margins. Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off-domain iframe to

    the HTML returned will expand horizontally to the size of its parent
    container.

other categories. The following parameters are defined:

``html`` (required)
    The HTML required to display the resource. The HTML should have no padding
    or margins. Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off-domain iframe to
    avoid XSS vulnerabilities. The markup should be valid XHTML 1.0 Basic.
