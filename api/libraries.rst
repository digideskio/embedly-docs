Tools
-----
Here is a list of the current set of tools that easily integrate with Embedly:

`Embedly Wordpress`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Embedly plugin allows bloggers to embed videos, images, and rich media
from |num_providers| sources with just the url. It uses the Embedly API to
get the embed code and display it in a post. This plugin extends the Embedly
framework in WordPress 3.1 and up. Embed any URL using the built-in TinyMCE
modal tool.

`Drupal oEmbed`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This module will allow your Drupal site to embed content from
oEmbed-providers, as well as for the site to become an oEmbed-provider itself,
so that other oEmbed-enabled websites can easily embed your content. Since
version 6.x-0.6 this module comes with an autoupdating support for embedding
content with Embedly.
