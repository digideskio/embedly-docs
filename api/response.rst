Response Objects
================
A list of common response objects across endpoints.


.. _response-types:

Response Types
--------------
Response types are different then oEmbed types. They closely follow the mimetype
for a given resource. They are as follows:

``html``
    The most common response. The resource is an ``html`` document.

``text``
    The response is a plain ``text`` document.

``image``
    This is a static viewable ``image``.

``video``
    This is a playable ``video``.

``audio``
    This is a playable ``audio``.

``rss``
    The resource is an ``rss`` feed.

``xml``
    The resource is an ``xml`` document.

``atom``
    The resource is an ``atom`` feed.

``json``
    The resource is a ``json`` document.

``ppt``
    The resource is a PowerPoint document.

``link``
    This is a general embed that may not contain HTML.

``error``
    When accessing multiple urls at once Embedly will not throw HTTP errors as
    normal. Instead, it will return an ``error`` type response that includes the
    ``url``, ``error_message`` and ``error_code``.

.. _safebrowse:

Safe
----
Safe is an attribute that tells you if the url is on a phishing or malware
list. Embedly uses Google's
`Safe Browsing API <http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/>`_
to obtain a list of malicious urls. By using this API through our service,
you agree to its
`terms of service <https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/terms>`_.

When the ``safe`` attribute is ``false``, there will be two additional
attributes in the response:

``safe_type``
    Either be ``"phishing"`` or ``"malware"``. The phishing list is from
    `antiphishing.org <http://www.antiphishing.org/>`_, and the malware
    list is from `stopbadware.org <http://www.stopbadware.org/>`_.

``safe_message``
    A user-readable message in HTML format explaining that the given url is likely malicious.

    If ``safe_type`` is ``phishing``, the message will be:

    .. code-block:: html

        <b>Warning- Suspected phishing page.</b> This page may be a forgery or imitation of another website, designed to trick users into sharing personal or financial information. Entering any personal information on this page may result in identity theft or other abuse. You can find out more about phishing from <a href="http://www.antiphishing.org">www.antiphishing.org</a>. Advisory provided by <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/safebrowsing_faq.html#whyAdvisory">Google</a>

    If ``safe_type`` is ``malware``, the message will be:

    .. code-block:: html

        <b>Warning- Visiting this web site may harm your computer.</b> This page appears to contain malicious code that could be downloaded to your computer without your consent. You can learn more about harmful web content including viruses and other malicious code and how to protect your computer at <a href="http://www.stopbadware.org">StopBadware.org</a>. Advisory provided by <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/safebrowsing_faq.html#whyAdvisory">Google</a>

Once a url is flagged as malicious, you must respect the ``cache_age``
attribute. When ``cache_age`` expires, you must **not** show the message
again until you have reevaluated that url with Embedly. This helps to mitigate
false positives and ensure compliance with the
`terms <https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/terms>`_
of Google's Safe Browsing API.

.. _place:

Place
-----
The ``place`` object gives location data associated with the url. You can
find this data in the :doc:`Preview <legacy/endpoints/1/preview>` and
:doc:`Objectify <legacy/endpoints/2/objectify>` endpoints. An example ``place``
for a `Foursquare venue </docs/explore/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoursquare.com%2Fvenue%2F46205>`_
would be:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "title": "Dupont Circle Metro Station",
        "url": "http://foursquare.com/venue/46205",
        "region": "DC",
        "locality": "Washington",
        "longitude": 77.043256759643555,
        "postal_code": "20036",

.. _event:

Event
-----
The event object gives time and details data, which is associated with the url. You can find
this data in the :doc:`Preview <legacy/endpoints/1/preview>` or
:doc:`Objectify <legacy/endpoints/2/objectify>` endpoints. An example ``event`` value
for `Eventbrite </docs/explore/preview?url=http%3A%2F%2Fxsite2011.eventbrite.com%2F>`_ would be:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "end": 1308263400000,
        "description": "Register now and enter to win a Galaxy Tab 10.1! The first 50 paid registrations in June will be entered in a drawing to win a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer.",
        "title": "XSITE 2011: The Xconomy Summit on Innovation, Technology & Entrepreneurship",
        "start": 1308226500000,
        "offset": -14400000,
        "id": "1590716877"
    }

    End time in milliseconds from epoch.

``offset``
    UTC offset in milliseconds. Allows you to localize the time to the user's time zone.

``id``
    Unique identifier for the ``event`` by the ``provider``.

.. _microformats:

Microformats
------------
The microformats object is used to extract semantic metadata contained in
a page's markup. This data is only available from the
:doc:`Objectify <legacy/endpoints/2/objectify>` endpoint.

``tags``
    A dictionary of tagged links, designated with ``"rel=tag"``, used
    to indicate keywords for the page.  See `microformats.org
    <http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag>`_ for more info. An example
    ``tags`` value for an `e-commerce site
    </docs/explore/objectify?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunfactory.fr%
    2Fen%2Fpersonalized-gifts%2Fstatuette-trophy-soccer-player-football.html>`_
    is:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "trophy": "http://www.sunfactory.fr/en/tag/trophy/",
            "soccer": "http://www.sunfactory.fr/en/tag/soccer/",
            "statuette": "http://www.sunfactory.fr/en/tag/statuette/"
        }

``xfn``
    A dictionary of tagged links describing relationships, as defined by the
    `XHTML Friends Network <http://gmpg.org/xfn/>`_. ``xfn`` is a dictionary
    of each tag, in which the value is a list of objects with a ``title``
    and an ``href``.

    Here is an example response for a
    `Google+ profile </docs/explore/objectify?url=https%3A
    %2F%2Fplus.google.com%2Fu%2F0%2F101327394875436414046>`_:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "xfn": {
                "me": [
                    {
                        "href": "http://twitter.com/doki_pen",
                        "title": "Twitter"
                    },
                    {
                        "href": "http://twitter.com/kalimbahn",
                        "title": "kalimbahn"
                    },
                    {
                        "href": "http://pulse.yahoo.com/_A4SBHEWDD6I4DDC4IDFOLCXJ2I",
                        "title": "Robert Corsaro"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }

    ``me`` is just one of many xfn tags, which describe relationships. Others
    include ``parent``, ``friend``, and ``sweetheart``. See
    `the xfn spec <http://gmpg.org/xfn/11>`_ for many more.

``author``
    A list of tagged links as specified by the `rel author microformat
    <http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-author>`_. ``author`` is a list of
    each tag in which each value is a dictionary of the name and href of the
    author. Here is an example response for a `Mashable post <http://embed.ly/d
    ocs/explore/objectify?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2F2011%2F11%2F16%2Fchil
    l-hulu-livestream-vevo%2F>`_:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "author": [
                {
                    "href": "http://mashable.com/author/sarah-kessler/",
                    "name": "Sarah Kessler"
                }
            ]
        }


.. _images:

Images
------
A list of, at most, 5 images that Embedly found while processing the URL. They
are in the following format:

.. code-block:: json

    [
      {
        "url": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/110920105905-black-troy-davis-execution-00012107-story-top.jpg",
        "width": 640,
        "height": 360
      },{
        "url": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/110922033940-bts-mcphail-execution-reaction-00004718-story-body.jpg",
        "width": 300,
        "height": 169
      },{
        "url": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/110922024436-ac-macphail-mom-davis-scotus-reax-00002001-story-body.jpg",
        "width": 300,
        "height": 169
      },{
        "url": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/110922024320-ac-davis-execution-denied-00025001-story-body.jpg",
        "width": 300,
        "height": 169
      },{
       "url": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/110922015709-piers-troy-davis-pastor-execution-00002001-story-body.jpg",
        "width": 300,
        "height": 169
      }
    ]

Embedly looks at the following attributes of the page and then ranks and scores
the images.

    * If the oEmbed type is ``photo`` the url of the oEmbed object
    * The ``thumbnail_url`` of the oEmbed object if the oEmbed type is not
      ``photo``
    * The Open Graph ``og:image`` property
    * The ``meta`` ``image_src`` tag.
    * Any images found in the API response.
    * Images ranked and pulled from the body of the page.

The scoring system is weighted heavily toward larger images and images within
structured responses, but images in the ``head`` of the document don't always
appear first in the list. ``og:image`` and ``image_src`` are generally small
thumbnails that don't always represent what's on the page. We have found better
results when giving them higher scores, but not defaulting them to the first
image. Note that they will always appear in the results, even if we rank images
pulled from the page higher.

``images`` only appear in the :doc:`Preview <legacy/endpoints/1/preview>` and
:doc:`Objectify <legacy/endpoints/2/objectify>` endpoints, and you can use
``images`` in a couple of ways:

    * If there is no user interaction, you can just select the first image
      out of the array and display it like so:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            $('<img />').attr('src', obj.images[0].url);

    * If you're creating a Facebook-like URL selector tool, then you can
      display a list of images that a user can select from:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            var ul = $('<ul></ul>');

            $.each(obj.images, function(i, img){
                ul.append($('<li></li>').html($('<img>').attr('src', img.url)));
            )};
