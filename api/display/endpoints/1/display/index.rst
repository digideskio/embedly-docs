Display Proxy
=============
The Display endpoint is a simple proxy that allows you to embed insecure images into
secure pages without warning and uses a fall back image for images not found.

Example call (1 URL)::

    https://i.embed.ly/1/display?key=<key>&url=<url1>&errorurl=<url2>

Example
--------
* `<https://i.embed.ly/1/display?url=http%3A%2F%2Fembed.ly%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsquiggle2.png&key=xxxxx>`_

Arguments
---------

``key`` (required)
    The :doc:`API key <../../../authentication>` for your registered account. OAuth is
    not currently supported.

``url`` (required)
    The URL of the image to proxy. The URL must be url-encoded to ensure that
    Embedly retrieves the correct link. For example, this Embedly
    URL::

        http://embed.ly/static/images/squiggle2.png?v=1

    Should be sent as::

        http%3A%2F%2Fembed.ly%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsquiggle2.png%3Fv%3D1

``errorurl``
    The URL of the fall back image to use when ``url`` fails. The URL must be
    url-encoded to ensure that Embedly retrieves the correct link. For example,
    this Embedly URL::

        http://embed.ly/static/images/squiggle2.png?v=1

    Should be sent as::

        http%3A%2F%2Fembed.ly%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsquiggle2.png%3Fv%3D1
