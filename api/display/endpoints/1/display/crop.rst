Image Crop API
==============
Crop an image to fill the given dimensions. The image will first be resized to it's
smallest possible size that will fill the entire given dimensions, preserving
it's aspect ratio.  The image is then centered within the given dimensions,
and any part of the image that doesn't fit is removed. The same amount is
trimmed from each side of the image in the cropping dimension.
