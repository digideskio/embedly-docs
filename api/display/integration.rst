Integration
===========

``Display`` can be integrated with our :doc:`/api/embed/index`
and :doc:`/api/extract/index` products to resize and proxy images for any
URL. This integration also includes proxying all images over SSL.

API Query Arguments
-------------------
It is possible to invoke the ``Display`` image proxy through both the
:doc:`/api/embed/endpoints/1/oembed` and :doc:`/api/extract/endpoints/1/extract`
endpoints. These arguments allow you to apply a uniform ``image_width`` and
``image_height`` to every image that Embedly passes back through the API
response.

If you need different sizes for different images, you should use
:doc:`index` directly.

Example
^^^^^^^
Using the following query arguments will manipulate every image that is passed
back in the Embedly response. Here is an example call::

  http://api.embed.ly/1/extract?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geek.com%2Farticles%2Fmobile%2Fjournalist-goes-undercover-making-the-iphone-5-at-foxconn-20120912%2F&image_height=100&image_method=fill&image_error_url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tumblr.com%2Ftumblr_m9e0vfpA7K1qkbsaa.jpg&image_width=100&key=key

Arguments
---------

``image_method``
  Defines what method Embedly will use to resize the image. Valid values are:

    ``resize``
      :doc:`i.embed.ly resize <endpoints/1/display/crop>`
    ``crop``
      :doc:`i.embed.ly crop <endpoints/1/display/crop>`
    ``fill``
      :doc:`i.embed.ly fill <endpoints/1/display/fill>`

  The default value is ``resize``.

``image_width`` (required)
  The width that the image should fill.

``image_height`` (required)
  The height that the image should fill.

``image_grow``
  Set to `true` if growing the image is allowed. Otherwise it will never expand
  beyond it's original size, making width and height behave like max width and
  max height. This is only a valid option when ``image_method=resize``.

``image_color``
  The css color to fill with. Colors should be 3 or 6 hexadecimal characters.
  Some examples of valid colors:

  * 000
  * 4f2a55

  This is only a valid option for the ``image_method=fill``. The default
  color is ``000``.

``image_error_url``
  The URL of the fall back image to use when the image at ``url`` can't be
  processed (or doesn't exist). The URL must be url-encoded to ensure that
  Embedly retrieves the correct link. For example, this Embedly URL::

    http://embed.ly/static/images/squiggle2.png?v=1

  Should be sent as::

    http%3A%2F%2Fembed.ly%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fsquiggle2.png%3Fv%3D1

``secure``
  Set to `true` to SSL proxy all images passed back through our
  :doc:`/api/embed/index` or :doc:`/api/extract/index` endpoints.

  You'll notice that any image field such as `thumbnail_url` has changed from::

    http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/117/311/117311910_1280.jpg

  to::

    https://i.embed.ly/1/display?url=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fts%2F117%2F311%2F117311910_1280.jpg&key=<key>

  Note that ``Display`` respects the cache time of the upstream
  image, so we will cache it locally for that period of time. This works for all
  image fields (thumbnail_url, open_graph.image, etc.) passed back.
