Mobile
======
With the number of different types of devices these days, it's hard to define
what mobile means to developers these days. Embedly supports mobile devices in
that our Embeds work on iOS, Andriod or any other device that supports common
HTML5 features.

However our support is limited to only the providers that support all mobile
devices. The good news that most platforms work everywhere.

HTML5
-----
If your site or app runs via a browser then you have nothing to worry about.
Use Embedly the same way you would in any website.

If Embedly detects that an embed is being served via Flash then we will show a
thumbnail and a play button instead of trying to Embed the Flash object if you
are on an iOS device.

iOS
---
If you are building a native app in iOS then we highly recommend checking out
our `iOS <https://github.com/embedly/embedly-ios>`_ Library. It contains all
the code you will need to embed videos with Embedly.

Android
-------
If you are building a native app in Android then we recommend using our
`Java <https://github.com/embedly/embedly-java>`_  Library.
